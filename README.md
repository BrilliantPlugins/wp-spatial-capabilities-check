# WP Spatial Capabilities Check

![See what spatial functions your MySQL or MariaDB data supports](assets/banner-1544x500.png)

Find out what spatial functions your WordPress database supports.

MySQL and MariaDB both have improved their spatial support in the last few years, but 
it's not always easy to track down which functions are available in which version.

This tool will check which functions are actually available in your current MySQL or MariaDB database.

## Instructions

Install this plugin, then go to your WordPress dashboard to Tools::Spatial Capabilities. It will
display a table with a list of all known spatial functions from MySQL and MariaDB along with a
simple 'Yes' or 'No', indicating if your install has that function.

## Screenshots

WP Spatial Capabilities Check shows an easy to read table listing spatial functions and if they're available with your current database.
